## FAQ

* Why did not added comment block into the post?

> Because I have only small time slice on writing and maintain this blog.

* Do you do open source for your projects?

> I am not guarantee what I share will meet your expectation, basically I like to share the information/meterials so that the DIY is possible to be duplicate. also the project can be re-work for better performance base on the share information. But I don't like to see someone only change the logo/name and decalare as a new product.

* Do you sale the boards or elements?

> I have no plan to sell anything right now. but maybe I will sell something mature audio boards in the comming days.

* Do you do another projects?

> Yes. I am a software programmer and an EE engineer.

* Why blogging in English/Chinglish?

> As many projects are inspired/forked/learned from opensource projects, try to write in English for better cross reference between projects.
