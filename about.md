## FAQ

* Why did not added comment block into the post?

> Because I have only small time slice on writing and maintain this blog.

* Do you do open source for your projects?

> I am not guarantee what I share will meet your expectation, basically I like to share the information/meterials so that the DIY is possible to be duplicated, but I don't like to see someone only change the logo/name and decalare as a new product. For more details, you might file a bug/issue/request in github by project if the project was listed there.

* Does you DIY audio board play very good sound?

> This is a hard question, but please don't do duplicating with a high expectation. and you can mod accordingly.

* Do you give out bare PCB for free?

> Yes, if spare PCB is available. 顺丰到付

* Do you sale the boards or elements?

> I have no plan to sell anything right now. but maybe I will sell something mature audio boards in the coming months in offline shop. If you are one DIYer, duplicate with my released gerber and schematic will save money.

* Do you do another projects?

> Yes. I am a software programmer and an EE engineer.

* Why blogging in English/Chinglish?

> As many projects are inspired/forked/learned from opensource projects, try to write in English for better cross reference between projects.
